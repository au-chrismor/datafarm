# The DataFarm Project

## Introduction

This is a working framework for gathering data from gardens, tanks, vehicles and other things you will find on a small farm.  It is based on my own experiences and learnings as I go through the journey.

I live in an area where gathering and managing your resources is required, and it's important to know how much water or energy you are using, not only at the present time but historically as well.  There are plenty of ways to do this, and this is simply my take on the process.
